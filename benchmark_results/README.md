## Descriptions
Excel file summarizing the results of the performance benchmark of Bayesian optimization for 150 combinations of the computational batch size, noise mean, and noise standard deviation.

In the Performance column, the length of the list written in each cell is 101. The Nth element of the list represents the probability of finding one of the 10 most reactive allyl-vinyl-ether molecules in the barrier dataset after N-1 virtual experiments.
